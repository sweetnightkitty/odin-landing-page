# Odin Project Landing Page

This project is a practice project that was built in accordance with the ODIN Project Landing Page assignment to practice designing front-end layouts with CSS Flexbox.

I was provided with a design file as well as some theme colors and fonts to use for this design. Since the design was provided as a png file, I did my best to visually match the provided designs but the layout may vary slightly from the original.
